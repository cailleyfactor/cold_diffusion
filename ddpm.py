"""!@file ddpm.py
@brief Module containing tools for the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM).
@details Initialises the model, defines the forward pass, and provides a sampling function.
@author Created by C. Factor on 10/03/2024 and involves code from a
starter notebook provided by Miles Cranmer for the coursework project.
